# This Week's Goals

Just a practice of the lessons learned thus far in The Net Ninja [(@thenetninjauk)](https://twitter.com/thenetninjauk) React course.

## Design and Layout

I threw the UI together in Figma. [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/g3H9EqCUVD8f3SbUxUGLEz/net-ninja-events-in-your-area?node-id=2%3A6)

The fonts are Inter and Space Grotesk from Google Fonts. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
